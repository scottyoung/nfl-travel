Map Visualization of NFL Team travel per week


This map shows of each NFL Team's stadium and where they are travelling (or hosting) each week.  It uses D3.js to draw the map
and stadiums, as well as the matchup lines.  Stadiums are colored to represent the 2 major colors of that team.

Real-time data is pulled in to show the team records when a stadium is hovered.  Week selectors in the top left allow you to
review or preview different weeks.
